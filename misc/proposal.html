		<td>The topic we are proposing to investigate is AI (artificial intelligence) Music. AI music 
			can be defined as the involvement of algorithms and machine-learning techniques to 
			analyse, create, and perform music. It incorporates various applications such as music 
			composition, production, analysis, and performance. AI music is designed to mimic or 
			augment human creativity in music by leveraging data and algorithms to generate 
			original or innovative music pieces. As music is a significant part of most people's lives, 
			uniting communities together, we are interested in the positive and negative effects 
			that it could introduce in fast-paced technological environment.</td>

		<tr>
		<th scope="row">Topic Relevance/Importance</th>
		<td>We believe this topic is relevant today as the newly introduced AI music algorithms has 
			the potential to modernise and change the music industry, particularly the younger 
			generation and up-and-coming artists. Not only will AI music influence music creation, 
			music recommendation, production, and live performances it poses challenges that 
			need to be addressed such as legal and ethical implications, to make sure its influence 
			on society is positive. The preservation of music-culture is important for our generation 
			hence why we propose to investigate this topic.</td>
